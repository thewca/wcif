### TimeLimit

Represents a time under which an attempt(s) must be completed. See [regulation A1a](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#A1a) for more details.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `centiseconds` | `Integer` | The time. |
| `cumulativeRoundIds` | `[String]` | An empty array the time limit applies to each attempt. |

#### Example

}
```

### Cutoff

Represents an attempt result the competitor needs to beat in one of the first phase attempts in order to be eligible for the remaining attempts. See [regulation 9g](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9g) for more details.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `numberOfAttempts` | `Integer` | The number of attempts the competitors has to get an attempt better than `attemptResult`. |
| `attemptResult` | [`[AttemptResult]`](#attemptresult) | The attempt result that needs to be beaten in order to be eligible for the remaining attempts. |

#### Example

{
  "numberOfAttempts": 2,
  "attemptResult": 3000,
}
```

### AdvancementCondition

Represents a requirement a competitor must satisfy in the given round in order to advance to the next round of the event.
See [regulation 9p2](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9p2) for more details.
Regardless of the advancement condition type, [regulation 9p1](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9p1) must be applied.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `"ranking"\|"percent"\|"attemptResult"` | The type of advancement condition. Either of ranking (top N competitors), percent (top X% of competitors) or attempt result (competitors with result better than Y - either single or average as per [9p2+](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#9p2+)). |
| `level` | [`Ranking`](#ranking)\|[`Percent`](#percent)\|[`AttemptResult`](#attemptresult) | The parameter of advancement condition of the given type. |

### Ranking

An `Integer` number of competitors.

### Percent

An `Integer` (between 0 and 100, inclusive) representing a percent of competitors (rounded down to the nearest integer).

### AttemptResult

An `Integer` representing a competitor result in a single attempt.

The following values are defined to have special meaning:
- `0` represents a skipped attempt (e.g. an attempt may be skipped if a competitor does not meet the cutoff)
- `-1` represents a DNF (Did Not Finish)
- `-2` represents a DNS (Did Not Start)

In the default case the value represents the number of centiseconds measured
(e.g. `1:10.25` would be represented as `7025`).

For 3x3x3 Fewest Moves the value represents the number of moves,
but averages are represented as 100 times the average
(i.e. an single result of `25` moves is represented as `25`, while an average result of `25.33` moves is represented as `2533`).

For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind the value encodes the time as well as the number of cubes attempted and solved
(designed so that a lower value means a better result).\
An attempt result `0DDTTTTTMM` encodes the following information:
- `timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)`
- `difference    = 99 - DD`
- `missed        = MM`
- `solved        = difference + missed`
- `attempted     = solved + missed`

*Note: the leading zero indicates that this is the New Multi-Blind format, as opposed to the Old one having a leading 1.
As the other format is very old and doesn't need to be supported by new applications, the specification omits it entirely.*

### Qualification

Represents a requirement that a person must satisfy to qualify to register for the given event.
See paragraph 5.1 of [WCA Competition Requirements Policy](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/documents/policies/external/Competition%20Requirements.pdf) for more details.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `whenDate` | [`Date`](#date) | The date by which the qualification requirement must be satisfied.  If a result is set in a multiple-day competition which ends before this date, that is considered to have been set by this date. |
| `type` | `"attemptResult"\|"ranking"\|"anyResult"` | The type of qualification. Either of ranking (top N competitors), attempt result (competitors with result better than Y - either single or average) or any result (competitors with any successful result of the given type). |
| `resultType` | `"single"\|"average"` | The type of result the requirement refers to. |
| `level` | [`AttemptResult`](#attemptresult)\|[`Ranking`](#ranking)\|`null` | The parameter of the qualification condition of the given type. Not used with `anyResult`. |

#### Examples

```json

  "level": null
}
```

### Result

| `ranking` | `Integer\|null` | The ranking in this round. May be `null` if the result is empty (yet to be entered). |
| `attempts` | [`Attempt`](#attempt) | List of attempt results the competitor got. If there are fewer attempts than expected, the rest is considered skipped (effectively `0`). |
| `best` | [`AttemptResult`](#attemptresult) | The best attempt result of `attempts`. |
| `average` | [`AttemptResult`](#attemptresult) | The average attempt result of `attempts` (depending on the format, either average of 5 or mean of 3). |

#### Example

{
  "personId": 1,
  "ranking": 10,
  "attempts": [...],

### Scramble

A `String` representing a single scramble (a sequence of moves used to mix up the given puzzle).
Scrambles for official competitions are generated by [TNoodle](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles).

For 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, where each attempt involves many physical puzzles to be mixed up,
the value consists of all the individual scrambles separated by a new line (`"\n"`).

### ActivityCode

A `String` identifying something happening at the competition.

###### Official WCA activities

Format: `{eventId}[-r{roundNumber}][-g{groupName}][-a{attemptNumber}]`

For example, these are all valid WCA activity codes (in decreasing specificity):

|  Activity code | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `333-r1-g3-a1` | 3x3x3 Cube, Round 1, Group 3, Attempt 1 |
| `333-r1-g3` | 3x3x3 Cube, Round 1, Group 3 |
| `333-r1` | 3x3x3 Cube, Round 1 |
| `333` | 3x3x3 Cube |

In some events (e.g. 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, 4x4x4 Blindfolded, 5x5x5 Blindfolded) all attempts aren't necessarily done in the same group. Because of this, the code may specify an attempt without regard to group.
Here are some valid WCA activity codes for 3x3x3 Multi-Blind (in decreasing specificity):

|  Activity code | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `333mbf-r1-g3-a2` | 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, Round 1, Attempt 2, Group 3 |
| `333-r1-a2` | 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, Round 1, Attempt 2 (any group) |
| `333-r1` | 3x3x3 Multi-Blind, Round 1 |
| `333` | 3x3x3 Multi-Blind |

Activities may be nested. If an activity A contains a child activity B, then activity B's code must contain all items from the parent activity's code.

For example:

- `333-r1-g3` is a valid child of `333-r1`
- `444bf-r1-g3-a1` is a valid child of `444bf-r1-g3` or `444bf-r1`
- `333-g3` is **not** a valid child of `333-r1`
- `333-r2-g3` is **not** a valid child of `333-r1`

###### Other activities

Format: `other-{id}`

The specification defines the following common IDs:

|  Activity code | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `other-registration` | Registration at the venue. |
| `other-checkin` | Check-in at the venue. |
| `other-tutorial` | Tutorial for new competitors. |
| `other-multi` | Submission of multi-blind cubes in advance of an attempt. |
| `other-breakfast` | Breakfast time. |
| `other-lunch` | Lunch time. |
| `other-dinner` | Dinner time. |
| `other-awards` | Awards ceremony. |
| `other-unofficial-{activityCode}` | Unofficial event. The activity code should follow the rules above, except that the event id will be competition-specific. Where possible, the event ids listed [here](http://cubing.github.io/icons) are recommended. For example, `other-unofficial-magic-r1-g3` is a possible activity code. |

All other activities not defined by the specification should use either `other-misc` or `other-misc-{id}`.

### Date

A `String` representing the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### DateTime

A `String` representing a date and time according to [ISO 8601
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

### Extension

Represents custom data that may be added to several WCIF entities.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | The extension identifier. Should follow the Java package naming convention, starting with a URI related to the developer and specifying the object in question. |
| `specUrl` | `String` | A valid URI pointing to a published specification documenting the format of their extension (e.g. using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org)). |
| `data` | `Object` | An object containing an arbitrary extension-specific data compliant with the documented format. |

#### Information

Users of custom extensions should have lower expectations about how permanent the specifications are.
While fields defined by this specification should be expected not to change regularly,
users of custom extensions should expect to update their code more regularly as the extension specifications evolve.

Developers who create extensions that become widely used are expected to propose additions of their custom fields to this specification.

Any application that consumes WCIF data should (whenever possible) save extensions as JSON blobs and include them in future WCIF outputs.

#### Motivation

Many developers will find it useful to attach data related to their specific application,
which may not be used widely-enough to include in this specification. For example:
- references to entities in their datastores
- data such as shirt sizes for competitors, which has not yet been proven to be generalized
- data such as US states where competitors live, which is only relevant to applications in the USA

Finally, this helps to protect the specification from bloat or namespace pollution,
by allowing developers to introduce new fields before they are proven to be generally useful.

#### Example

```json
{
  "id": "org.someapplication.Stage",
  "specUri": "https://someapplication.org/wcif/stage.json",
  "data": {
    "timingStations": 16,
    "area": 50
  }
}
```
